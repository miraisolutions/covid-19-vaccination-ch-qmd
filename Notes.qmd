## R Packages

With latest version of knitr and all packages we observed a problem with rendering plotly graphs.

The 'yaml' package is required to parse dependencies within Quarto Markdown files. To be added to the renv project

## renv

Source:

https://community.rstudio.com/t/possibility-to-specify-renv-for-quarto-render/161423

  `renv` can be added, the DESCRIPTION file can be first placed in the project to allow renv::restore()

Update to `R 4.3.0`, update of renv lock.

## Shiny

The Quarto website is ultimately a static website - it won't be responding to user input or running any R code. You can embed a shiny app into a qmd that you render in the rstudio IDE and it'll work just fine because the shiny app is running in a session on your computer. Website hosting services like quarto-pub, netlify, and gh-pages will only be serving up the html pages of the site, not running the code necessary to operate the shiny app in response to user input.

Shiny #\| context: server does not pick the objects run the R chunks,

Use #\| context: data 

## Shinyapps.io

The Qmd file cannot be in the INST folder, when deploying to Shinyapps.io 
Like for the Rmd it must be copied to the project directory.
