## R Packages

With latest version of knitr and all packages we observed a problem with rendering plotly graphs.

The 'yaml' package is required to parse dependencies within Quarto Markdown files. To be added to the ren project

## renv

renv can be added, the DESCRIPTION file can be first be in the project to allow renv::restore()

We could use the same set up as for the old app:

R. 4.2.1 Same renv.lock file.

## Shiny

The Quarto website is ultimately a static website - it won't be responding to user input or running any R code. You can embed a shiny app into a qmd that you render in the rstudio IDE and it'll work just fine because the shiny app is running in a session on your computer. Website hosting services like quarto-pub, netlify, and gh-pages will only be serving up the html pages of the site, not running the code necessary to operate the shiny app in response to user input.
